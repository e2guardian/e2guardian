# 2. Installation

You can install E2Guardian on any linux based system and guidelines are provided to compile from sources. 
A debian package is also available to install on Debian based distros.

## 2.1 Installation on Ubuntu

This document details the installation of E2guardian (from now on E2G) on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04, but it should work on any Debian derivates and reasonably recent versions of Ubuntu.

On github you will find an overview of the different e2guardian releases:

<https://github.com/e2guardian/e2guardian/releases>

On that page the top release should be the stable one, but check the message associated with it. 
At the time of this howto latest stable is 5.5.3. 
You can also directly access the latest release by using this link:

<https://github.com/e2guardian/e2guardian/releases/latest>


### 2.1.1 Installation from repositories

E2G is available in the Ubuntu repositories starting with version bionic (18.04LTS)
but may not contain the latest release, so you might prefer to download the latest release (see below).

ÃŒnstall e2guardian with:

    sudo apt-get install e2guardian

Hint: this will also install the virus scanner clamav.

### 2.1.2 Download package

You will find precompiled packages on

<https://e2guardian.numsys.eu/>

the filename resembles the linux distribution and release and the e2guardian version and release time.
e.g.:

- e2raspbian_buster_V5.5.1_20201116.deb
- e2debian_buster_V5.5.1_20201013.deb
- e2ubuntu_focal_V5.5.1_20200911.deb

Download the package and install it with:

    sudo dpkg -i <package-name>

### 2.1.3 Installation from source

You may even install e2guardian from the source code, that means: 
fork the repository, make and compile the code.
So you will use the latest version of e2guardian, but as this is mostly
done by software developers, we will describe this in section (8. For Developers)

### 2.1.4 Installation with a docker container

Docker is a easy way to install even complex applications <https://www.docker.com/why-docker>.

You will find some ready to deploy docker containers on <https://hub.docker.com/>

If you have installed docker on your system it is as easy as:

    docker run -d --name="e2guardian" -p 8080:8080 beechfuzz/e2guardian

to start e2guardian on your system.    


## 2.2 Installation of an additional proxy

As e2guardian does NOT cache the downloaded websites you may prefer to add an additional proxy server to your system. (a proxy server was required prior to E2G V5)

The most common one is squid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)>,
recommended for large/full blown installation, while tinyproxy is probably ideal for small setups and small boxes or virtual machines with less than 2GBs of ram.

### 2.2.1 Installation of Squid

To install squid simply run:

    sudo apt-get install squid

squid by default listens on port 3128 for request which is also the default port used by E2G to talk to the proxy.

For more details how to configure squid please look at <http://www.squid-cache.org/>

### 2.2.2 Installation of Tinyproxy

If you decide to go with tinyproxy there's an extra step. First off get that installed by doing:

    sudo apt-get install tinyproxy

then you need to change the default port tinyproxy listens on to match what's in E2G's default configuration. E2G expects to talk to the proxy on port 3128, which is what squid defaults on, but tinyproxy by default works on port 8888.

To fix this edit /etc/tinyproxy.conf, find port 8888 and change it to port 3128 and restart tinyproxy by doing 

    sudo /etc/init.d/tinyproxy restart

## 2.3 Installation of an additional virus scanner

E2guardian uses a plugin system for content scanners. We provide plugins for the following virus scanner:

- Avast  <https://www.avast.com/en-gb/business/products/linux-antivirus>
- ClamAV <https://www.clamav.net/>
- Command Line Scanner
- ICAP Scanner
- Kaspersky <https://support.kaspersky.com/kes10linux>

If you have E2G installed directly from the linux repository, clamav was installed too,
else you may install ClamAV with:

    sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-freshclam

TODO: Please have someone docs how to install Avast/Kaspersky ??

## 2.4 Installation on Windows

Sorry, e2guardian can NOT be installed on Microsoft Windows !!

( But with Windows 10 there is "WSL Windows Services for Linux" 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux>  
Maybe someone has tried to install e2guardian in WSL and may share his experience here?? )
