# 7. Advanced Configuration

## 7.1 List definitions

Version 5 has a completely revised model for defining and using lists.  
List definition is now separated from list application. 
These are no longer hard-coded, but mapped to an action using a storyboard function.

So, for example, the following entries in V4 e2guardianf1.conf :

    exceptionsitelist = '/etc/e2guardian/lists/exceptionsitelist'
    exceptionurllist = '/etc/e2guardian/lists/exceptionurllist'
    exceptionregexpurllist = '/etc/e2guardian/lists/exceptionregexpurllist'

are replaced in V5 with:

    sitelist = 'name=exception,messageno=602,path=/etc/e2guardian/lists/exceptionsitelist'
    urllist = 'name=exception,messageno=603,path=/etc/e2guardian/lists/exceptionurllist'
    regexpboollist = 'name=exception,messageno=609,path=/etc/e2guardian/lists/exceptionregexpurllist'

and this line added to the storyboard logic to map the 'exception' list(s) to the 'exception' action:

    if(urlin, exception) setexception

Note that the list name 'exception'  above does not have any special meaning to e2guardian v5, it is just a label for some lists.
Blanket block indicators in list files are no longer actioned.  
Blanket block is now implemented with storyboard states 'siteisip' and 'true', e.g.

    if(siteisip,,505) return setblock' 

will display message number 505 - 'Access to sites by IP address is not allowed' in the block page).

### Categories

Categories are still defined within lists as before with the following syntax:-

    #listcategory: “CATEGORY”

Time based lists are also honoured, although this method is depreciated and may be replaced by a more auditable method in a future version.

### List Definition

List definition has the following format:

    listtype = 'name=list_name, [messageno=nnn,] [logmessageno=lll,] [anonlog=true,] [sitewild=false,] path=path_to_list_file 
                [ ,listdir=dir_path ]'

where:

* listtype is one of the types in Table 1.
* list_name is a label made up of alphanumeric, '_' and '-' (no spaces).  
  The same list_name can (and should) be used for multiple listtypes,
  as this enables a single storyboard function to check multiple listtypes.  
  For example the urlin storyboard state condition will search
  sitelist, ipsitelist, urllist, and regexpboollist listtypes.
  Note that list_name must be unique within each listtype.  
  Where a list_name/listtype combination is duplicated all but the last one read will be ignored.
  Which listtypes of a list_name that are used and the order they are used in
  a storyboard condition is determined by the storyboard state condition used.
* nnn is a message number for block message displayed to user and status number entered into log (types 5 & 6) – default is 0.
* lll is the message number for log message – default is messageno
* anonlog=true anonymises log entries where this list is matched (Default is false)
* sitewild=false overrides the standard site 'wildcard' behaviour for site and url lists. 
   i.e. An exact match will be required for the site name.  
   This is quicker as only a single list check is required.
   With the standard sitewild logic (number of '.' in site)+1 checks are required.
   (Default is true)
* path_to_list_file is fully qualified path to list file.
* list_dir is a list path – this will replace any __LISTDIR__ variables in the list 
  defaults to the current LISTDIR value I.e listdir=__LISTDIR__

**Table 1 – List Types**

See configs/e2guardian.conf and configs/e2guardianf1.conf for example entries.

## 7.2 Story Board

Version 5 has a revised model for logic flow and using lists.  

Storyboarding is a simple scripting language which defines functions 
that control list checking, map actions to list matches and controls logic flow.

Each filter group can use a different storyboard and so can have different logic if required.
The lists used and logic can now also be changed without stopping and re-starting e2guardian.

### 7.2.1 The Storyboard files

A storyboard file defines **functions** which contains **command lines**
which checks **states** or **lists** and may modifies **flags**.

Certain 'entry point' functions must be defined as e2guardian will use these as entry points into the function engine.

These functions are:

* 'pre-authcheck' for authorization of the client
* 'checkrequest' checking the request of the client
* 'checkresponse' checking the response of the server

Further entry point functions are required when transparent https

* thttps-pre-authcheck & thttps-checkrequest, thttps-checkresponse

or ICAP

* thttps-pre-authcheck & icap-checkrequest & icap-checkresponse

are enabled.  

A storyboard file can include other storyboard files, allowing a structured approach to
function definitions with common functions being defined in a common included file.
Functions can be redefined with the last read version overwriting the previous one.

Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

In the standard distribution the following storyboards are provided:

* preauth.story  
    – pre-authorization storyboard  
    – used before filtergroup is determined and defined in e2guardian.conf
* common.story  
    – Storyboard library for inclusion in filtergroup storyboards.  
    – Provides standard 'checkrequest', 'checkresponse', 'thttps-checkrequest', 'thttps-checkresponse', 'icap-checkrequest' and 'icap-checkresponse' entry-point functions as well as a number of library functions.  
    – For smooth upgrades DO NOT edit this file. 
      When you need to change a standard function, redefine it in the site storyboard  or in an individual filtergroup storyboard.
* site.story  
    – Example storyboard for site specific additional or changed functions, for inclusion in filtergroup storyboards.
* examplef1.story  
    – Example of a filtergroup storyboard

### 7.2.2 Function Definition

The start of a function is defined with:

    function(function_name)

    function_name is a label made up of alphanumeric, '_' and '-' (no spaces)  
    Do not use labels starting with 'true', 'false', 'set', 'unset' or 'return' 
    as these may conflict with built-in actions.

The end of a function is defined with:

    end()

    or by the start of a new function
    or by an include
    or by the end of the file.

A function must be completely defined in a single file and consists of one or more command lines which are executed in order.

A function will have one or more command lines.

A function will return a boolean value. If the function returns false, then ???

### 7.2.3 Command Line Format

The format of a command line is:

    Command(Condition)[return || returnif ]Action

where:

    Command is:
        – if  - Condition is true do Action  
        – ifnot - if Condition is false do Action
    Condition format is:
        state[,[list][,message_no[,logmessage_no]]]
    where:-
        – state is as listed in Table 1.
        – list is list name (mandatory if state ends in 'in')
        – message_no is a message number (overrides messageno in list definition or used when no list) default 0
        – logmessage_no – (overrides logmessageno in list definition or used when no list) default message_no
    Action is:
        – a built-in action (see Table 2) or a function name

if Action is prefixed with return then return from the current function with the return value of Action

if Action is prefixed with returnif then return true from the current function if Action returns true

### 7.2.4 Tables of States, Actions and Flags

**Table 1a – States which require lists**

## 7.3 ICAP-Server

TODO

## 7.4 Extended Room functions

Hosts in a room can have a override list of urls with or without a blanket block function.
You may enable the room functions in the main configuration file e2guardian.conf:

    perroomdirectory = '__LISTDIR__/../rooms/'

Now you can populate this directory with files with the following format:

1st line must contain a '#' followed by the room name

The following lines define the IP ranges, one IP or range per lines e.g.

    172.167.58.3
    172.167.59.1-172.167.59.65  
    177.167.60.0/255.255.255.0  
    177.167.61.0/24  

End the list with: #ENDLIST

Then optional whitelists can be added by using #SITELIST or #URLLIST
Each list must be ended with #ENDLIST

To block all access (other than listed in one of the above lists) use #BLOCK.

If #BLOCK is absent than the trusted sites listed will overide any block in the users filter group.

So there are 4 cases:-

1. #BLOCK and no (#SITELIST or #URLLIST) - block all access
2. #SITELIST and/or #URLLIST and no #BLOCK - trust these urls and allow normal access.
3. #SITELIST and/or #URLLIST and #BLOCK - only allow these urls.
4. #SITELIST, #URLLIST, #BLOCK all missing - Legacy format file - block all access.

e.g.

    #MyRoom
    172.167.58.3
