August 2011 - DansGuardian 2.12.0.0 - alpha

- Search term filtering
- POST data scanning

- HTTPHeader bug fixes re. persistent connection detection,
  crash in some (unknown) circumstances when trying to tunnel POST data

- Support individual log items up to 32KB in length, which may require multiple calls to getLine to read in. 
  
  
2010 - DansGuardian 2.11.*.*
- Unreleased.


Fri 5th June 2009 - DansGuardian 2.10.1.1 - stable
- Add "originalip" option to e2guardian.conf, for determining
 the original destination IP in transparent proxy set-ups, and
 ensuring that the destination domain of the request resolves to
 that IP.  This can help to address a particular transparent
 proxy security vulnerability (US-CERT VU#435052), but because of
 certain limitations - only implemented on Linux/Netfilter;
 potential breakage of websites using round-robin DNS - the code
 is not enabled by default.  Enable by passing "--enable-orig-ip"
 to the configure script.
 - Fix a crash which could occur when dealing with simultaneous
 incoming connections in configurations using more than one
 listening socket.
 - Fix a crash when checking time limits on item lists.
 - Fix potential usage of uninitialised memory during phrase
 filtering.


Wed 21st January 2009 - DansGuardian 2.10.0.3 - stable

- uClibc++ compilation patch from Natanael Copa.
- Fix crash on exit when running out of memory during phrase tree
preparation, from Victor Stinner.
- Clean up destructors for various objects, removing code duplication
with reset() methods.
- Compilation fixes from Jeffrey A. Young.
- Better handling of whitespace (tab characters) in configuration files.
- Fix HTTPS access for unauthenticated users when using basic or NTLM
authentication plugins.
- Reload list files on soft restart if cached (".processed") files have
been updated directly, from Harry Mason.
- Chop carriage return off useragent strings when "loguseragent" is
enabled.
- Don't force contents of e2guardianf*.conf files to lower-case on
loading, so as not to destroy the case of group names.
- Make temporary bypass cookies valid for subdomains of the original
bypassed domain, including stripping "www.".


Wed 26th November 2008 - DansGuardian 2.10.0.2 - stable
- Fix persistent connection detection to resolve issues with HTTP 1.1
browsers (Firefox), NTLM authentication and HTTPS websites.
- Change supported syntax for blocking HTTPS site access by IP to match
that documented in the default bannedsitelist (use "*ips", as
documented, NOT "**ips").


Tue 21st October 2008 - DansGuardian 2.10.0.1 - stable
- Improve malformed URL detection (dc2008.de no longer incorrectly
classed as malformed).
- Improve persistent connection detection, correcting some situations in
which DG would return a blank page to browsers.
- Updated "proxies" weighted phrase list.
- Updated Chinese Big-5 messages file from Vicente Chua.

Wed 8th October 2008 - DansGuardian 2.10 - STABLE!

- Fixed handling of content with no MIME type: it will be phrase filtered,
but no Content-Type header will be inserted into the response, so a
browser's own automatic type detection doesn't get interfered with
- Fixed a performance issue with CONNECT requests being incorrectly marked
as persistent, identified by Jason Deasi
- Updated the man page (Jens Wilke) and French messages file (Jeanuel)
- Clarifications to some of the included documents (INSTALL, UPGRADING)
- Considered stable (future planned changes are fairly wide reaching, so
work will continue in a new series of beta releases)

Thu 11th September 2008 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.8
- Assume that content with no Content-Type header is HTML, so that it
doesn't bypass the phrase filter.
- Fix some incorrect usage of integer types in ListManager and
ListContainer which can lead to crashes in some rare cases.
- Escape certain characters in URLs when displaying the HTML template to
prevent XSS.
- Don't add responses other than "200 OK" to the clean URL cache.


Mon 18th August 2008 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.7 - stable-surely
- Fixed problem with PID file creation when pidfilename is not
explicitly given in the config.


Wed 13th August 2008 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.6 - stable-surely

Build system clean-ups:
- Use pkg-config to detect PCRE and ClamAV, not pcre-config and
clamav-config.  Please note that this means DG now depends on
pkg-config.
- Remove platform.h.in and use preprocessor symbols from dgconfig.h
directly
- Define preprocessor symbols corresponding to directory names using
CXXFLAGS in the makefile, not platform.h, as the latter is no longer
processed by the autotools
- Remove checks in configure script for functions not actually called by
the code
- Remove a lot of obsolescent tests from the configure script, and get
rid of platform.h completely as a result

Improvements/bugfixes:
- Fix an off-by-one error in NaughtyFilter which could result in phrase
matching code looking at an uninitialised byte during filtering
- Allow regular expression comments with PCRE
- Fix a child process handling error which would cause DG to become
unresponsive if restarted then soft-restarted in quick succession


Mon 9th June 2008 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.5 - do-we-really-still-call-it-beta
- IP range & subnet support in banned & exception IP lists.
- Honour "--with-sysconfsubdir" setting when installing config. files.
- Code clean-ups: remove some unused function arguments, and eliminate
  compiler warnings from checks enabled by default in recent versions of
  GCC.
- New contributed Polish pornography and "good" weighted phrases.


Tue 29th April 2008 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.4 - beta
- Replaced quicksort with std::sort when loading in site & URL lists -
should behave better with pre-sorted input.
- Switch back to original compressed data before sending content to
clients, if the decompressed data is found to be zero length (i.e. just
compression headers).
- Change file blocking logic; exceptionextensionlist and
exceptionmimetypelist are now always loaded, and can override the banned
lists (much more similar to URL/domain blocking).
- ClamAV plugin updated to work with 0.93-style unpacking limits (only;
no support for 0.92.1 or earlier).




Wed 27th February 2008 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.3 - beta
- Large file (2GB+) download & scanning support
- Updated German block page template from Peter Vollmar
- Small fix to phrase matching to allow it to match the full 0-255 range
for each byte, improving foreign language filtering
- Fix for incorrect interpretation of URLs containing colons in list
files (long standing but rare bug; could cause memory corruption and
match failures)
- More documentation added to the installation (not new content, but
docs that were previously only in the source tarball now get installed)


Thu 13th December 2007 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.2 - beta
- Fixed a few memory leaks, including a fairly large one in the String
class.
- Attempt to allocate less memory when reading in phrase lists (start
small, and resize the block if needed).
- Check for out-of-memory conditions when loading phrase lists, as this
was a common cause of segfaults on soft restart on systems with low free
memory (daemon will still die, but a bit more gracefully).
- Re-worked phrase filtering: fix occurrence counting for combination
phrases, and possible performance improvements in weightedphrasemode 2.
- Digest auth support (based on contributions by Darryl Sutherland).
- uclibc compatibility patch from Gentoo Linux.
- Example of headerregexplist usage: force filtering on Windows Live
Search by cookie modification.
- Contributed updates to some of the language templates.
- Miscellaneous other bug fixes, applications of const correctness, etc.

Mon 13th August 2007 - DansGuardian 2.9.9.0 - beta

- Fix settings validation to allow maxcontentfiltersize to be set to 0.
- Tidy up option data types (hexdecodecontent, forcequicksearch and
usecustombannedimage are now "on"/"off" instead of 1/0).
- Tweak exception logging (logexceptionhits now has 3 supported values).
- Improved pre-emptive blocking for HTTPS requests.
- Altered blanket block implementation to also allow blanket exception &
grey domain/URL list matching (eg you can have allow everything).
- Added exceptionfileurllist in addition to exceptionfilesitelist.
- Added outgoing HTTP header blocking & modification.
- Added optional domain and URL lists for categorisation without blocking.
- Enabled TCP_NODELAY on all TCP sockets to work around a
performance hit with persistent connections.
- Improved phrase loading code to allow null bytes in phrases.  Should
allow for support of phrases in encodings such as UTF-16.


Tue 27th March 2007 - DansGuardian 2.9.8.5 - beta

- Fix behaviour of maxcontent* settings when set to zero ("cascading"
values).
- Don't allow daemon to start with maxcontent* settings all zero.
- Tweak config. validation to better check for allowed values.
- Fix memory corruption/leaks in PICS and ClamAV (not ClamD) code.
- Protect against more types of IP obfuscation.
- Minor cleanups in string class.
- Add contributed Japanese messages & template.html.

DansGuardian 2.9.8.3 and 2.9.8.4 - beta
- Never fully released

Mon 22nd January 2007 - DansGuardian 2.9.8.2 - beta
- "managedmimetypelist" and "managedextensionlist" made into an
either/or match, instead of both.
- Handle single dots on the end of domain names (e.g.
"http://www.cnn.com./").
- Typo fixes to a few error messages and config files.
- Allow WebDAV/OWA to work.
- Fix a bug in the phrase filtering that was introduced along with the
enhanced character encoding support.
- Add a little more info to error messages generated by failure to
connect to the URL cache, as some people seem to be having trouble with
it.



Fri 8th December 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.8.1 - beta
- Pre-emptive blocking re-introduced, but for authed users only (don't
retrieve anything, even headers, from banned sites/URLs; helps defeat
trackers).
- Build option to record a backtrace on segmentation fault
("--enable-segv-backtrace").
- Rudimentary performance testing options (add -D__BENCHMARK to your
CXXFLAGS when compiling to make some extra command-line options
available; content to be tested is read in on standard input).
- Syslog logging support.
- Performance increase for weightedphrasemode 2.
- Reduce some ListContainer code duplication.
- FAQ and plugin documents added, see doc subdirectory.

Mon 25th September 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.8.0 - beta

preserved, and once without (aid support for exotic character encodings).
- OpenBSD fixes, with thanks to Soner Tari.


Wed 9th August 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.7.5 - alpha
- Fixes a logic error with persistent authentication, i.e. NTLM
(and ident by IP when not obeying x-forwarded-for headers). POST upload
blocking didn't work because it is skipped for unauthenticated users,
and persistent authentication methods weren't setting the authenticated
flag for every request.


Tue 8th August 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.7.4 - alpha
- Updated Dutch translations.
- Tweaks which may or may not fix cpu load issues.

- Fixed (some?) IE POST problems (hopefully) which were introduced since
persistant connection support.


Fri 28th July 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.7.2 - alpha

- Handle more simultaneous phraselist character encodings (help
alleviate the infamous "more than 60 links from this node" error).
- Fixed POST upload problems with NTLM.
- Nicer error messages when phrase tree cannot be built (human-readable
version of "more than 60 links from this node").
- Correctly parse ICAP URLs without explicit port numbers.


Thu 8th June 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.7.1 - alpha

- Don't phrase filter non-text content when AV is enabled.
- Free up unused memory after loading phrase lists.
- Corrections to persistent connection detection.
- Moved looking up of client hostnames for logging back into
ConnectionHandler, to remove potential bottleneck introduced in last
version.
- Don't convert regular expressions to lowercase when reading in from
list files! (Big difference in meaning between e.g. \W and \w).
- Fixed memory leak in ipToHostname.


Mon 8th May 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.7.0 - alpha

- Added -SERVERIP- placeholder in fancy DM template.
- icapscan compatibility greatly enhanced (known working with servers from
Symantec, Dr. Web, Trend Micro, AVIRA and Kaspersky ICAP {unreleased}).
- ListContainer and HTTPHeader performance enhancements.
- "pathprefix" option in clamdscan & kavdscan, for compatibility with
daemons inside chroot jails.
- Auth by IP plugin correctly ignores blank lines in the ipgroups file.
- "reportinglevel = -1" is now allowed in filter group config files.
- Time-limited regular expression lists (not fully hierarchic, just checks
top-level file and file containing the current expression).
- Don't log garbage when logclienthostnames is enabled and a client IP has
no DNS record.
- Read in maxcontentfilecachescansize option correctly.
- Delete temp files after sending when a partially downloaded file becomes
too big to scan (default DM).
- Safe handling of files larger than maxcontentfilecachescansize in the
fancy DM (new "maxdownloadsize" option in fancy.conf).
- Email notification of blocked pages/viruses (--enable-email compile
option, various new configuration options; patch by J. Gauthier).
- Direct tunnelling of traffic from exception sites (that are excepted
from both filtering and virus scanning).
- Various other bugfixes & build tweaks.
- Includes the latest updated phrase lists.


Mon 3rd April 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.6.2 - alpha

- NTLM username strings are correctly terminated after conversion from
UTF-16LE.
- Spelling mistake fixed in ukenglish template.html.
- Fixed "-c" option (Jason Gauthier).
- Slightly tweaked handling of exception CONNECT (HTTPS) requests -
should help those with IE & SSL problems.
- Tweaked detection of persistent connections (HTTP 1.1 requests are
assumed persistent unless marked otherwise, as per standards).
- Buffered network input in BaseSocket::getLine (fewer system calls
during HTTP header retrieval).
- Optional logging of child process handling operations
(logchildprocesshandling).
- Conditional installation of contentscanners, lists/contentscanners and
lists/downloadmanagers directories.
- Fancy DM has managedextensionlist enabled by default, not
managedmimetypelist.


Fri 3rd March 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.6.1 - alpha

- Improvements/fixes to filter group range checking (auth by IP plugin
usable again - sorry!).
- URL cache sorting & searching fixed.
- Workaround for clients that send lowercase "host:" headers.
- Workaround for certain types of Squid-unfriendly request (allows more
clients to work with DG+Squid used as a transparent proxy).
- Updated Turkish language files (Ozgur Karatas).
- Confusing "--with-libiconv=yes" configure option removed; iconv check
now looks for library in standard search path automatically if a
platform-native iconv function is not found.
- Iconv library check looks for both "iconv" and "libiconv" functions -
should help OS X 10.3 users.
- Time limits are applied hierarchically to included list files, as has
been the intention for a while now (obviously the feature is not widely
used :P).
- Case-insensitive handling of HTTP headers (Nerijus Baliunas).


Mon 20th February 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.6.0 - alpha

- "ident" auth plugin supports usexforwardedfor when determining client
IPs.
- Range checking on filtergroup returned from auth plugins (pointed out
by Götz Babin-Ebell).
- Auth by IP plugin ignores entries in ipgroups which specify an
out-of-range filtergroup, and prints warning messages when it encounters
them.
- Fixed "SafeNetalcoholtobacco" typo in PICS settings file.
- Changed handling of POST uploads; large files should no longer cause
timeouts.
- There are now default managed extension/MIME type lists under.
"/etc/e2guardian/lists/downloadmanagers", and the latter is enabled by
default in the fancy download manager's config file.Götz Babin-Ebell.
- Optional blanket download blocking, with new exception MIME and
extension lists for overriding the block (existing banned MIME &
extension lists not used in this mode - everything not excepted is
banned).
- New "exceptionfilesites" list, for defining domains which are not
subject to filtering by MIME type or extension, i.e. trusted download
sites.
- Log format changes: IP and hostname are both logged (instead of using
one field for either); group name & number are now separate fields.
- Connections are correctly closed after being sent a download link from
the fancy download manager.


Thu 2nd February 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.5.0 - alpha
- Auth by IP plugin works without PCRE.
- When using auth by IP, credentials are cached for the lifetime of a
persistent connection, instead of querying the plugin for every request
(unless usexforwarded for is enabled).
- Added blanket SSL block (**s) and blanket SSL IP block (*ips).
- All usernames show up as lowercase in the logs.
- Auth plugins get reloaded on -g (allows changes to IP plugin's.
ipgroups file to take effect as well as changes to the filtergroupslist).
- Added allow per-group override of reportinglevel (hence per-group choice
between HTML template & external access denied address).
- Fixed a few memory leaks & some minor memory corruption.


Wed 25th January 2006 - DansGuardian 2.9.4.0 - alpha
- NTLM and proxy auth plugins renamed to "proxy-ntlm" and "proxy-basic"
- Fixed child process failure after -g
- Changed clamav's memory scanning method (uses more reliable parts of
Clam API; both clamav and clamdscan should now detect the same viruses)
- Unfortunately the new method does involve saving to file first;
however, you can use POSIX shared memory on supported platforms, or
specify a ramfs/tmpfs location, with a fallback to using the standard
filecachedir.
- Also, the temp directory used internally by libclamav can be configured.
- zlib can optionally be statically linked
- Improved handling of HEAD requests and HTTP redirects
- Improved error logging in clamav & clamdscan
- clamdscan now issues "SCAN" command instead of "CONTSCAN" (stops
scanning after the first error/virus is found)
- kavdscan can handle archive files containing multiple viruses (patch
submitted by littlecahya)
- More verbose output in debug mode
- Improved default & fancy download managers handling of files larger
than maxcontentfiltersize (or maxcontentfilecachescansize)
- Filter groups can be named
- Only load filter group 1's settings if no auth plugins are loaded
- Changed -FILTERGROUP- placeholder to return group name
- Added -RAWFILTERGROUP- placeholder for retrieving group number
- Added -SERVERIP- placeholder; returns the IP on which the filter is
running (returns correct address if using multiple filterip options;
returns 0.0.0.0 if filterip is blank)
- URL cache now stores the group(s) for which a URL is clean, in
addition to URLs themselves (cannot access a page with a score beyond
your naughtiness limit if someone in a group with higher limit/different
phrases has previously accessed it)
- Fixed child process crashes when using maxips option, and add logging of
IP usage statistics (new statlocation option)


Wed 21st December 2005 - DansGuardian 2.9.3.2 - alpha
- Adds logging of upstream proxy return code & user's filter group number

- NTLM plugin handles UTF-16 usernames.
- Improved child process responsiveness when using tunnels.


Tue 6th December 2005 - DansGuardian 2.9.3.0 - alpha and approaching feature complete

- Added NTLM Auth support.
- IP Auth plugin now supports X-Forwarded-For headers.
- Added Persistent connection support to allow pass through of a number of
protocols like NTLM and others that break without persistent connections.  It also should
improve performance.

show the top phrase categories matched.
- Performance enhancements to phrase filtering.

- Fixed URL regular expression search & replace.
- Fixed hexdecodecontent handling of a page's last few bytes.
- Fix for empty pages with gzip & zlib encoding.
- Fixed content-length header for pages with content modifications.



Tue 8th November 2005 - DansGuardian 2.9.2.0 - alpha and feature incomplete
- Filter groups now define a "filtering mode": banneduserlist and
exceptionuserlist support have been removed, and replaced with the
concept of a user being a member of a group which is in banned/filtered/unfiltered
mode.
- Added plugin-based authentication system - proxy and identd auth methods are
now provided as plugins.
- Added auth by IP plugin - maps individual IPs, IP ranges & subnets to filter
groups.
- Download managers support optional extension/mimetype inclusion lists,
for additional limiting of which requests get handled by a given manager.
- Fancy download manager supports HTML templates.

(not just as part of the "reason" string on weighted phrase banned
requests).
- Now includes a lot of example content and URL regexps.
- Now includes latest phrase lists.
- Fixed PICS enable/disable option fixed (PICS now disabled by default).
- Fixed filter bypass links cannot bypass the blocking of files virus scanned
and found to be infected: you can now only download known infected files
by being a member of an exception filter group (if contentscanexceptions
is disabled), or by being in a group with disablecontentscan set.
- Fixed improved extension detection for downloads from CGI scripts - fewer
downloads can now slip through the net.
- Fixed exceptionvirusmimetypelist support (i.e. it now works).
- Fixed improved behaviour of logclienthostnames option.
- Fixed configure script checks that the installed PCRE version is recent
enough, if building with PCRE support.


Mon 24th October 2005 - DansGuardian 2.9.1.0 - alpha and feature incomplete

demonstrate this feature).
- Added Korean PICS support.
- Added new phrase filtering mode: looks only at contents of title & meta tags.
- Added case insensitive detection of headers retrieved from webservers which
don't obey standards.
- PCRE support is now optional at configure time (--with-pcre; disabled by
default).
- e2guardian.org removed from exceptionsitelist, and a rule added to
bannedregexpurllist, to prevent accidental access to the DG sample virus repository.
- Firefox DoS fix in contentregexplist (commented out by default to conserve CPU).
- Fixed Grey URL list checking scans greyurllist, not bannedurllist.
- Fixed support for matching multiple URLs which differ only by a suffix.
- Fixed ClamD/KavD so they now run as both the same user & group as DG and
successfully access temp files.




Wed 19th October 2005 - DansGuardian 2.9.0.1 - alpha and feature incomplete
- Designed from scratch easily pluginable download management system which works with the...
- Designed from scratch content scanner system with a simple plugin system which makes it easy to write new content scanners such as the included AV.

Wed 30th January 2002 - DansGuardian-2.3.0-1
- Total rewrite of the phrase searching code.  Now it uses an advanced Deterministic Finite Automata Graph Algorithm.  This means the searching on large phrase lists is faster by several times.  On small lists it makes no difference, but lists over 300 no longer slow it down as much as it used to.
- Almost all console errors are now logged in SysLog for easier problem solving.
- The exception matching now logs (configurable) exception hits which makes it easier to find out why a certain page is not blocking.
- Exception phrases are now seperated into a different file for ease of maintaining and no longer need the '!'.

Fri 15th March 2002 - DansGuardian-2.2.7-1
- Recompiled statically linked binaries with updated zlib.  The fixes a double free bug in zlib which DansGuardian uses which makes it theoretically possible for a web site to cause denial of service or even run arbitrary code.  This only affects those that do not compile from source but users are advised to update their zlib and recompile if needed.

- Content-Encoding: deflate - finally works.
- Fixed bug in file extension checking which caused .com domains to be blocked.
- Added Blanket IP Block feature which allows IP based URLs to be blocked.
- Added forward dns lookup feature where it looks up the hostname for an IP based URL and checks for it in the bannedsitelist and bannedurllist.  This closes a big security loop hole that allowed users to simply type the IP of a banned site instead to bypass the URL filtering.  The forward dns lookup checks all the aliases for that IP as well.
- Improved the URL filtering so that all variants of web addresses don't need to be listed, eg www.domain.com/blah/ and domain.com/blah/.  Now just the highest level domain (domain.com/blah/) is needed.
