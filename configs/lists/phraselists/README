Revised Phaselists

These updated phrase lists are held in language directorys.

Protex has updated the ukenglish lists and this is a snapshot of the work
doen by Protex staff on these lists.  The updated lists give a much reduced
rate of false positives than the old phrases lists.

Languages other than English - I have populated these with what information I
have, but a number of languages have very sparse lists, and urgently need
revison by native speakers.

If you have better lists then please contribute them so that the lists
can be more complete.

Whan v5.4 is released the new phraselist will be the default.

The old phraselists are also distributed in the ../oldphraselists directory
