# IP sites which are NOT to have their certificates checked (when in MITM mode)
#
# Do not check ssl certificates for IP sites listed
#
# Can be used to allow sites with self-signed or invalid certificates
# or to reduced CPU load by not checking certs on heavily used sites (e.g. Google, Bing)
# Use with caution!
# Ignored if mitmcheckcert is 'off'

# IP site addresses 
#
# Single IPs, ranges and subnets can be used,
# e.g.
# 192.168.0.1
# 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.3
# 10.0.0.0/24
