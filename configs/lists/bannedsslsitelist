#domains in banned ssl list
#Don't bother with the www. or the https://
#This list is only used for SSL (or CONNECT) requests
# and will not have any effect when MITM is enabled.
#Unlike the bannedsitelist it overides all other lists
# so can be used ban an https site white the http is allowed or made an exception
# 
#Only list sites where you only want the https site blocked
#Use bannedsitelist for sites where you want both http & https blocked
