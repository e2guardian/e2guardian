#Sites in semi exception list

# These sites are made exception unless url is in banned list.

#Don't bother with the www. or
#the http://
#
#These are specifically domains and are not URLs.
#For example 'foo.bar/porn/' is no good, you need
#to just have 'foo.bar'.
#
# IP must be put in semiexceptionsiteiplist
#
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example


# Time limiting syntax:
# #time: <start hour> <start minute> <end hour> <end minute> <days>
# Example:
##time: 9 0 17 0 01234
# Remove the first # from the line above to enable this list only from
# 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

# NOTE: From v5 Blanket exceptions are now implimented using Storyboarding 
# WARNING: Old style Blanket blocks in this file will be silently ignored
