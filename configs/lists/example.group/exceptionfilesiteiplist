# Use this list to define ip sites from which files can be downloaded,
# overriding a blanket download block (blockdownloads = on) or the
# banned MIME type and extension lists (blockdownloads = off).

# DOES NOT override content/virus scanning or site/URL bans.

# IP site addresses
#
# Single IPs, ranges and subnets can be used,
# e.g.
