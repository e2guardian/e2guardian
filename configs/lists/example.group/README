### Lists in this directory relate to a single filter group
### each filter group has it's own directory

###
### Many of the exception/grey/banned site/ipsite/url lists are used for
### switching on/off standard list categories
###
### Where available it is best to use the LOCAL lists for your own lists of
### sites/urls as these override the main ones.

## Order of checking is broadly as follows:-
##
## 1. If in Local Exception lists - allow with no further checking
## 2. If in Local Grey lists - retrieve page and content-check
## 3. If in Local Banned lists - block with no further checking
## 4. If in Main Exception lists - allow with no further checking
## 5. If in Main Grey lists - retrieve page and content-check
## 6. If in Main Banned lists (or blanket blocked) - block with no further checking
## 7. If gets here  - retrieve page and content-check
## 8. Check blocked/exception file/mime types.
## 9. Content-check page

## Lists in this directory:-

# Nocheckcert lists
# Do not check ssl certificates for sites listed
# Can be used to allow sites with self-signed or invalid certificates
# or to reduced CPU load by not checking certs on heavily used sites (e.g. Google, Bing)
# Use with caution!
# Ignored if mitmcheckcert is 'off'
#

# greyssl lists only used in onlymitmsslgrey mode to define sites that
# will be MITM

# Outgoing HTTP request header rules:
# Lists for blocking based on, and modification of, outgoing HTTP
# request headers.  Format for headerregexplist is one modification rule per
# line, similar to content/URL modifications.  Format for
# bannedregexpheaderlist is one regular expression per line, with matching
# headers causing a request to be blocked.
# Headers are matched/replaced on a line-by-line basis, not as a contiguous
# block.
# Use for example, to remove cookies or prevent certain user-agents.
