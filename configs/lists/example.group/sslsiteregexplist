#SSL site modifying Regular Expressions
#
# The format is: "extended regular expression"->"replacement straight string"
# E.g. "shit"->"censored" would replace all occurances of shit in any case.
# Far more complicated matches are possible.  See other sources for examples
# of extended regular expressions.
#
# Users are pointed at the replaced site transparently.
# This is used to 'cname' ssl sites and avoids having to adjust DNS
# and allows option of switching off/on depending on filter group.

# This list applies to the site only (not full URL) for
#   HTTPS sites (regardless of SSL MITM configuration).

# Do not use patterns with full urls in this list as they can never
#   match the site name.
