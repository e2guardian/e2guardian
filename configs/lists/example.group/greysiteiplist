# IP site in grey list

#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.

# IP site addresses
#
# Single IPs, ranges and subnets can be used,
# e.g.
# 192.168.0.1
# 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.3
# 10.0.0.0/24
