# HTTP response header modifying Regular Expressions
#
# The format is: "extended regular expression"->"replacement straight string"
# E.g. "shit"->"censored" would replace all occurances of shit in any case.
# Far more complicated matches are possible.  See other sources for examples
# of extended regular expressions.
#
# Headers are run through replacements line-by-line, not as a single block.
#
# To remove a header put "X-E2G-IgnoreMe:" as the replacement
# e.g. to remove 'upgrade:' headers
#"upgrade:.*$"->"X-E2G-IgnoreMe:"
