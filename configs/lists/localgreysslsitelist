#domains in SSL grey list
#Don't bother with the www. or the https://

#This 'grey' lists overrides the main site 'exception' lists for SSL allowing MITM to be enabled in order to check https full url.

# Use to overcome issue where ssl url is in local blocked url list but is overriden by main site exception list forcing tunnel mode and so url never checked.
