### AUTH section
###
### In the context of e2guardian authentication is primarly
### the determination of the filter group to be used.
###
### Some of the plug-in also return a username which is
### then used in the access log

# Auth plugins
#
# Handle the extraction of client usernames and groups from various sources,
# enabling requests to be handled according to the settings of the user's 
# filter group.
#

## There are five ways that e2g can be deployed and this affects the auth
## plugins available
## 
##
## 'Standalone' - e2g handles client and upstream traffic 
##
## 'Proxy-First' - client is logged in by proxy (squid)
##		   and proxy passes e2g the user name in a 'basic' proxy
##		   auth header
##
## 'Proxy-After' - client points to e2g which then uses upstream proxy
##		   This is the method used by dg/e2g until v5.
##                 If authentication is enabled on proxy, then
##                 'Transparent' or IP auth will not work. 
##
## 'Transparent' - 80/443 requests are redirected to e2g on gateway
##	           Can be used with Standalone or Proxy-After mode
##                 Note: only IP based plugins will be used in this
##                 and so normaly it is not possible to capture the
##                 user name.  However, devices using transparent
##                 can be put in their own default group.
##
## 'ICAP mode' - All trafic goes via squid and squid uses e2g as an
##                 ICAP server.
## ICAP has built in auth as username is supplied in the ICAP header
## by squid. The user is checked against the filtergroupslist to get the
## group.  To cater for the situation where user is missing ip based 
## plugins such as 'ip' can be used as fall back.
##
## Note that e2g can support multiple methods at the same time, 
## e.g. Standalone, Transparent and ICAP server


## There are three types of plugin
## 'Native', 'Proxy-first' and 'Proxy-after' 

## 'Native' plugins - these do not require use of a proxy

#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/ident.conf'
# Requires identd running on each client - gives username

# Group based on ip or ip range - pseudo username of the ip
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/ip.conf'

# Group based on e2g port number - pseudo username of the port
# for this option the ports have to be declared as multiple filterport line
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/port.conf'

# User and group obtained from dns entries mapping ip to user/group
# dns entries maintained by separate authentication program.
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/dnsauth.conf'

# HELP - more native plugins needed!  'basic' etc.

## 'Proxy-first' plugin - requires a proxy in front to do the user 
##  authentication.

# Use pf-basic.conf where proxy is doing auth in front of e2g
# New in v5.4
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/pf-basic.conf'

# User defined in header - requires interception prior to e2g
# to add headers
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/proxy-header.conf'

# ip plugin can also be used in Proxy first mode.

## 'Proxy-after' plugins - requires a proxy behind.
## These are pass-through plugins which reply on sniffing the
## proxy auth headers between client and proxy to get username
## - not recommended and will be removed in a future release

# Basic auth on back-end proxy
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/proxy-basic.conf'

# Digest auth on back-end proxy
#authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/proxy-digest.conf'

# NTLM (only v1) auth on back-end proxy
#@NTLMSUPPORT@authplugin = '@E2CONFDIR@/authplugins/proxy-ntlm.conf'

# All native plugins can also be used in proxy-after mode
# but only auth is not forced by the upstream proxy


## Auth mapping files - Map users (or client IPs) to filter groups
## Note that from v5.4 lists used by auth plugins are defined here and 
## not in auth *.conf files

# Generic user to group mapping - used by default by basic, digest, ntlm, 
# ident & icap plugins
maplist = 'name=defaultusermap, path=__LISTDIR__/../authplugins/filtergroupslist'

reverseclientiplookups = off
# Reverse lookups for banned and exception IP clients.
# If set to on, e2guardian will look up the forward DNS for the IP
# of the connecting computer.
# If a client computer is matched against an IP given in the lists, then the
# IP will be recorded in any log entries; if forward DNS is successful and a
# match occurs against a hostname, the hostname will be logged instead.

### DOWNLOAD_MANAGER section
###

# Download Managers
# These handle downloads of files to be filtered and scanned.
# They differ in the method they deal with large downloads.
# Files usually need to be downloaded 100% before they can be
# filtered and scanned before being sent on to the browser.
# Normally the browser can just wait, but with content scanning,
# for example to AV, the browser may timeout or the user may get
# confused so the download manager has to do some sort of
# 'keep alive'.
#
# There are various methods possible but not all are included.
# Also, not all methods work with all
# browsers and clients.  Specifically some fancy methods don't
# work with software that downloads updates.  To solve this,
# each plugin can support a regular expression for matching
# the client's user-agent string, and lists of the mime types
# and extensions it should manage.
#
# Note that these are the matching methods provided by the base plugin
# code, and individual plugins may override or add to them.

weightedphrasemode = 2
#
# Weighted phrase mode
# There are 3 possible modes of operation:
# 0 = off = do not use the weighted phrase feature.
# 1 = on, normal = normal weighted phrase operation.
# 2 = on, singular = each weighted phrase found only counts once on a page.
#
# IMPORTANT: Note that setting this to "0" turns off all features which
# extract phrases from page content, including banned & exception
# phrases (not just weighted), search term filtering, and scanning for
# links to banned URLs.
#

#phrasefiltermode = 2
#
# Smart, Raw and Meta/Title phrase content filtering options
# Smart is where the multiple spaces and HTML are removed before phrase filtering
# Raw is where the raw HTML including meta tags are phrase filtered
# Meta/Title is where only meta and title tags are phrase filtered (v. quick)
# CPU usage can be effectively halved by using setting 0 or 1 compared to 2
# 0 = raw only
# 1 = smart only
# 2 = both of the above 
# 3 = meta/title
# default 2

#preservecase = 0
#
# Lower casing options
# When a document is scanned the uppercase letters are converted to lower case
# in order to compare them with the phrases.  However this can break Big5 and
# other 16-bit texts.  If needed preserve the case.  As of version 2.7.0 accented
# characters are supported.
# 0 = force lower case (default)
# 1 = do not change case
# 2 = scan first in lower case, then in original case

# Note:
# If phrasefiltermode and preserve case are both 2, this equates to 4 phrase
# filtering passes. If you have a large enough userbase for this to be a
# worry, and need to filter pages in exotic character encodings, it may be
# better to run two instances on separate servers: one with preservecase 1
# (and possibly forcequicksearch 1) and non ASCII/UTF-8 phrase lists, and one
# with preservecase 0 and ASCII/UTF-8 lists.

#hexdecodecontent = off
#
# Hex decoding options
# When a document is scanned it can optionally convert %XX to chars.
# If you find documents are getting past the phrase filtering due to encoding
# then enable.  However this can break Big5 and other 16-bit texts.
# off = disabled (default)
# on = enabled

#forcequicksearch = off
#
# Force Quick Search rather than DFA search algorithm
# The current DFA implementation is not totally 16-bit character compatible
# but is used by default as it handles large phrase lists much faster.
# If you wish to use a large number of 16-bit character phrases then
# enable this option.
# off (default) | on (Big5 compatible)

#Eg
#       debuglevel = 'ALL,-ICAP'
#Enable all debug informations but without ICAP debug informations
#       debuglevel = 'ALL,-ICAP,-NET,-FILTER'
#Enable all debug informations but without ICAP, NETWORK and FILTER debug informations

### No settings just info on new features etc

# New in v5.4.2:- relative paths
# Relative paths can used in .Include<> and list files.
#       The directory of current file will be insert where the file name
#       does not start with '/'


# Also NEW in v5.4.2 - LISTDIR 'variable' definition
# LISTDIR can be defined in .conf files.
# This allows for more readable configuration and for templating.
# This works similarly to a shell environment variable
# The text between <> will replace occurances of __LISTDIR__ in .conf and
#       list files.
# Note: Currently only LISTDIR may be defined.
#
# The mapping is actioned as the file is read and is valid until another LISTDIR
#       is defined later in the file, or in an included .conf file.
#
# The scope of LISTDIR is in the rest of file it is defined in and all
# .Include<> files or list files in that portion of the file.
