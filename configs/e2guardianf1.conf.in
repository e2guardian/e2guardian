### QUICK_START section
###
### e2guardian will work using examplef1.story 
### and the example.group sub-directory of the lists directory
### without you making any changes to this file.
###
### The items you are likely to need to change in production are 
### in this section.
### 
### To set up for production:-
###
### In config directory:-
###   Copy examplef1.story to group1.story
### In list directory:-
###   Create a group1 directory
###   Copy the lists in lists/sample.group into this directory
###	and edit them to your requirements
### Comment out .define.., and storyboard = lines below.
###
### To add group two:-
###
### Copy this file to e2guardianf2.conf
### and repeat above steps, but for group2.story, lists/group2 directory etc
###
### Repeat for any further groups
###
### Remember to adjust the 'filtergroups' setting in e2guardian.conf
### to the number of groups you now have.

#groupname = 'my_name_for_group'
#
# Filter group name
# Used to fill in the -FILTERGROUP -placeholder in the HTML template file, and to
# name the group in the access logs
# Default 'group1' where 1 is the group number

storyboard = '@E2CONFDIR@/examplef1.story'   # comment out for production
#
# Storyboard logic for this group
#
# defaults to '@E2CONFDIR@/group1.story' where 1 is the group number

.Define LISTDIR <@E2CONFDIR@/lists/example.group>  # comment out for production 
# The directory path for list files for this group
# This path replaces __LISTDIR__ wherever it occurs below or in included files.
# See INFO section for full details
# defaults (initialized) as <@E2CONFDIR@/lists/group1> where 1 is the group number
 
#naughtynesslimit = 60
#
# Naughtiness limit
# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive
# values.  See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
# As a guide:
# 60 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.
# default 60

### URL_FILTERING section
###

#deepurlanalysis = off
# Enable Deep URL Analysis
# When enabled, E2 looks for URLs within URLs, checking against the bannedsitelist and
# bannedurllist. This can be used, for example, to block images originating from banned
# sites from appearing in Google Images search results, as the original URLs are
# embedded in the thumbnail GET requests.
# (on|off) default = off

###
### END of URL_FILTERING section 


### URL_MAIN_LISTS section
###
### Most of the site/ipsite/url lists in this section are used for
### switching on/off standard list categories
###
### It is best to use the LOCAL lists for your own lists of sites/urls
### as these have priority over the main ones.

## For info on the format of list definitions see notes/V5_list_definition

## Order of checking is broadly as follows:-
##
## 1. If in Local Semi Exception lists - set semiexception flag - jump to 4
## 2. If in Local Exception lists - allow with no further checking
## 3. If in Local Grey lists - retrieve page and content-check
## 4. If in Local Banned lists - block with no further checking
## 5. If semiexception flag still set - allow with no further checking
## 6. If in Main Semi Exception lists - set semiexception flag - jump to 9
## 7. If in Main Exception lists - allow with no further checking
## 8. If in Main Grey lists - retrieve page and content-check
## 9. If in Main Banned lists (or blanket blocked) - block with no further checking
## 10. If semiexception flag still set - allow with no further checking
## 11. If gets here  - retrieve page and content-check
## 12. Check blocked/exception file/mime types.
## 13. Content-check page

# Search term blocking
# Search terms can be extracted from search URLs and filtered using one or
# both of two different methods.

# Method 1 is that developed by Protex where specific
# search terms are contained in a bannedsearchlist.
# (localbannedsearchlist and bannedsearchoveridelist can be used to suppliment
# and overide this list as required.)
# These lists contain banned search words combinations on each line.
# Words are separated by '+' and must be in sorted order within a line.
#    so to block 'sexy girl' then the list must contain the line
#       girl+sexy
#    and this will block both 'sexy girl' and 'girl sexy'
# To use this method, the searchregexplist must be enabled and the bannedsearchlist(s) defined

# Method 2 is uses the
# bannedphraselist, weightedphraselist and exceptionphraselist, with a separate
# threshold for blocking than that used for normal page content.
# To do this, the searchregexplist must be enabled and searchtermlimit
# must be greater than 0.

# List of regular expressions for matching search engine URLs.  It is assumed
# that the search terms themselves will be contained in the
# of output of each expression.

#
# Search term limit (for Option 2)
# The limit over which requests will be blocked for containing search terms
# which match the weightedphraselist.  This should usually be lower than the
# 'naughtynesslimit' value above, because the amount of text being filtered
# is only a few words, rather than a whole page.
# This option must be uncommented if searchregexplist is uncommented.
# A value of 0 here indicates that search terms should be extracted,
# but no phrase filtering should be performed on the resulting text.

# Search term phrase lists (for Option 2)
# If the three lines below are uncommented, search term blocking will use
# the banned, weighted & exception phrases from these lists, instead of using
# the same phrase lists as for page content.  This is optional but recommended,
# as weights for individual phrases in the "normal" lists may not be
# appropriate for blocking when those phrases appear in a much smaller block
# of text.
# Please note that all or none of the below should be uncommented, not a
# mixture.

#embeddedurlweight = 0
#  - NOT implimented in v5
# Embedded URL weighting
# When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
# page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
# bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
# here to be added to the page's weighting.
# The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
# affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
#
# NB: Currently, this feature uses regular expressions that require the PCRE library.
# As such, it is only available if you compiled e2guardian with '--enable-pcre=yes'.
# You can check compile-time options by running 'e2guardian -v'.
#
# Set to 0 to disable.
# Defaults to 0.

### No settings just info on new features etc

# New in v5.4.2:- relative paths
# Relative paths can used in .Include<> and list files.
#       The directory of current file will be insert where the file name
#       does not start with '/'


# Also NEW in v5.4.2 - LISTDIR 'variable' definition
# LISTDIR can be defined in .conf files.
# This allows for more readable configuration and for templating.
# This works similarly to a shell environment variable
# The text between <> will replace occurances of __LISTDIR__ in .conf and
#       list files.
# Note: Currently only LISTDIR may be defined.
#
# The mapping is actioned as the file is read and is valid until another LISTDIR
#       is defined later in the file, or in an included .conf file.
#
# The scope of LISTDIR is in the rest of file it is defined in and all
# .Include<> files or list files in that portion of the file.
