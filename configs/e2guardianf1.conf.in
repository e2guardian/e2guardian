# e2guardian filter group config file for version @PACKAGE_VERSION@

# This file is re-read on gentle restart and any changes actions
# Filter group mode IS NOT LONGER SUPPORTED after 4.x
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned.
#
# 0 = banned
# Replaced by bannedsitelist and bannedsitelist
# To block all sites except those in the
# exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files remove
# the # from the next line to leave only a '**':
#
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.

# Used to fill in the -FILTERGROUP- placeholder in the HTML template file, and to

# Enable legacy (DG) ssl logic
#
# Note that the logic for handling SSL is changed. In DG when either blanket block (or SSL blanket block)
# was active then an SSL site would not be blocked if site name matched either exceptionsitelist or greysitelist.
# In e2guardian with blanket block (or SSL blanket block) active an SSL site will only be allowed if it matches
# exceptionsitelist or greysslsitelist. This ensures that only trusted sites can be accessed via SSL.
# The greysslsitelist is used in order to allow a site to drop through so that it's domain can be mangled via urlregexplist,
# e.g. To use the Google mechanism for prevention of https Google search, or to allow an SSL site whilst blocking the corresponding http: site.
#
# Default off (logic as above)
# For legacy (DG style) logic then set ssllegacylogic to on
# Note that MITM cannot work with this flag set
# ssllegacylogic = off

# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive

# As a guide:
# 50 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.

# Search term blocking
# Search terms can be extracted from search URLs and filtered using one or
# both of two different methods.

# Method 1 is that developed by Protex where specific
# search terms are contained in a bannedsearchlist.
# (localbannedsearchlist and bannedsearchoveridelist can be used to suppliment
# and overide this list as required.)
# These lists contain banned search words combinations on each line.
# Words are separated by '+' and must be in sorted order within a line.
# so to block 'sexy girl' then the list must contain the line
#   girl+sexy
# and this will block both 'sexy girl' and 'girl sexy'
# To use this method, the searchregexplist must be enabled and the bannedsearchlist(s) defined

# Method 2 is uses the
# bannedphraselist, weightedphraselist and exceptionphraselist, with a separate
# threshold for blocking than that used for normal page content.
# To do this, the searchregexplist must be enabled and searchtermlimit
# must be greater than 0.

# Search engine regular expression list (need for both options)
# List of regular expressions for matching search engine URLs.  It is assumed
# that the search terms themselves will be contained in the
# of output of each expression.
# searchregexplist = '@DGCONFDIR@/lists/searchregexplist'
#
# Banned Search Term list(s) for option 1
# bannedsearchlist = '@DGCONFDIR@/lists/bannedsearchlist'
# bannedsearchoveridelist = '@DGCONFDIR@/lists/bannedsearchoveridelist'

# Search term limit (for Option 2)
# The limit over which requests will be blocked for containing search terms
# which match the weightedphraselist.  This should usually be lower than the
# 'naughtynesslimit' value above, because the amount of text being filtered
# is only a few words, rather than a whole page.
# This option must be uncommented if searchregexplist is uncommented.
# A value of 0 here indicates that search terms should be extracted,
# but no phrase filtering should be performed on the resulting text.
# searchtermlimit = 0
#
# Search term phrase lists (for Option 2)
# If the three lines below are uncommented, search term blocking will use
# the banned, weighted & exception phrases from these lists, instead of using
# the same phrase lists as for page content.  This is optional but recommended,
# as weights for individual phrases in the "normal" lists may not be
# appropriate for blocking when those phrases appear in a much smaller block
# of text.
# Please note that all or none of the below should be uncommented, not a
# mixture.

# Category display threshold
# This option only applies to pages blocked by weighted phrase filtering.
# Defines the minimum score that must be accumulated within a particular
# category in order for it to show up on the block pages' category list.
# All categories under which the page scores positively will be logged; those
# that were not displayed to the user appear in brackets.
#
# -1 = display only the highest scoring category
# 0 = display all categories (default)
# > 0 = minimum score for a category to be displayed
categorydisplaythreshold = 0

# Embedded URL weighting
# When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
# page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
# bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
# here to be added to the page's weighting.
# The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
# affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
#
# NB: Currently, this feature uses regular expressions that require the PCRE library.
# As such, it is only available if you compiled e2guardian with '--enable-pcre=yes'.
# You can check compile-time options by running 'e2guardian -v'.

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass
# This provides a link on the denied page to bypass the ban for a few minutes.  To be
# secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the

# To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to edit the template.html
# or e2guardian.pl file for your language.

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass
# Similar to the 'bypass' setting, but specifically for bypassing files scanned and found
# to be infected, or files that trigger scanner errors - for example, archive types with
# recognised but unsupported compression schemes, or corrupt archives.
# The option specifies the number of seconds for which the bypass link will be valid.

# accessdeniedaddress is the address of your web server to which the cgi

# 1. Non-proxied. Either a machine on the local network, or listed as an
#    exception in your browser's proxy configuration.

# HTML Template override
# If defined, this specifies a custom HTML template file for members of this
# filter group, overriding the global setting in e2guardian.conf. This is
# only used in reporting level 3.
#
# The default template file path is <languagedir>/<language>/template.h
# e.g. @DGDATADIR@/languages/ukenglish/template.html when using 'ukenglish'
# language.

# This option generates a file path of the form:
# <languagedir>/<language>/<htmltemplate>
# e.g. @DGDATADIR@/languages/ukenglish/custom.html
#
# htmltemplate = 'custom.html'

# Non standard delimiter (only used with accessdeniedaddress)
# To help preserve the full banned URL, including parameters, the variables
# passed into the access denied CGI are separated using non-standard
# delimiters. This can be useful to ensure correct operation of the filter
# bypass modes. Parameters are split using "::" in place of "&", and "==" in
# place of "=".
