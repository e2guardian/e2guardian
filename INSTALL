HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
As of DansGuardian 2.9, the distribution uses GNU autotools for building.
Most users should therefore follow the standard
"./configure; make; make install" process common to UNIX packages.  If for any
reason you need to modify configure.ac or one of the Makefile.am files, use
autoreconf or the supplied autogen.sh script to regenerate the configure script
and Makefile.in files.

Please read the sections below for your OS for the most widely used
configuration options.

*** Solaris users, please read the Solaris section first. ***

*** xBSD users, please ensure you have bash1 installed first ***

*** OS X / Darwin users, please read the OS X section first. ***

As of DansGuardian 2.7.7-10 zlib 1.2.1 is required for gzip
support.  This change was to fix a bug that could not be fixed
with an earlier version.  If you do not want to upgrade zlib on
your system see the notes at the end about compiling in zlib
statically. As of 2.9.3.2, you can also specify a non-standard search
path for the zlib headers & library (during linking stage) using the
"--with-zlib" option.

As of 2.9.1.0, DansGuardian can optionally be compiled and linked
against PCRE instead of the standard GNU regular expression library.
This overcomes certain limitations of the standard library, allowing
- for example - character negations ([^w]). PCRE support is disabled
by default; version 6.0 or above is required. The "pcre-config" program
must be available in your PATH during build configuration.

As of 2.9.3.1, iconv support is necessary for using the NTLM auth
plugin. Some systems (e.g. Linux) provide this as part of their core
API; others (e.g. FreeBSD) require an external iconv library to be
installed. The "--with-libiconv" configure option enables linking with
an external iconv library. Charsets UTF-16LE and UTF-8 must be supported.


1.        Run the configure (./configure --help) script with
        the help option to see the user selectable settings.
        Default settings are shown in [].

2.        Run the configure (./configure) script with your
        options, if any.  It is HIGHLY LIKELY that you will
        want to change some options.  Please read down for
        suggested options for your platform.

3.        "make"** or "gmake" will now build DansGuardian.

4.        "make install" will create the directory structure and install
        all the files in the chosen paths.  For a more efficient
        install, try "make install-strip" which will strip symbol
	information to the DG binary smaller.

5.        "make clean" will remove the now un-needed object files etc.

6.        See the section later called ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS to add
        log rotation, optional CGI block page, startup scripts etc.


** You can often use "make -j 2" or "make -j 5" to compile DG faster,
   especially on multiple CPU computers.  As a general rule of thumb,
   use the number of CPUs/cores plus one.
   With Solaris and others you may need "gmake" instead of "make".
   


OPTIONS:
--------
You may change with the configure options:
  prefix           (architecture-independent files root path eg /usr/local)
  datadir          (where shared files and example scripts get placed)
  sysconfdir       (where the config and data files gets placed eg /etc)
  mandir           (where the man docs get placed)
  localstatedir    (where var/run and /var/logs are)

  with-piddir      (where the pid file gets placed eg /var/run)
  with-sysconfsubdir
                   (subdirectory of sysconfdir in which to place config files)
  exec-prefix      (architecture-dependent files ie bin files)
  bindir           (where the binary gets placed)
  with-proxyuser   (the system user the daemon runs as)
  with-proxygroup  (the system group the daemon runs as)

  enable-email     (enable support for email notification on block & virus
                    occurrences)
  with-libiconv    (non-standard search path for iconv library,
                    for platforms without native iconv (only used in
                    conjunction with enable-ntlm))
  with-zlib        (specify optional non-standard prefix for zlib
                    lib & include directories)
  
See ./configure --help for more details.

These options have changed slightly from older versions of DansGuardian
which did not use autotools.


HP-UX:
------

No specific notes are available.  Consult your documentation for file paths.
Otherwise follow the FreeBSD instructions which are likely to work.
(Contributions welcome!)



MACOSX:
-------

*** Note in order to do any compiling in OS X you need to install ***
*   the Developer Tools - an additional pkg called BSDSDK.pkg.      *

*** Note DG2.7.x does not currently work as it uses poll() which OSX ***
*   lacks.  There is a workaround though.  See:                        *
*** http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dansguardian/message/5027          ***

*** Note OS X version 10.3 now has poll() support see:      ***
*   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dansguardian/message/6072   *


A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
MACOSX and the associated programs in their default locations.

    ./configure --localstatedir=/var \
        --mandir=/usr/share/man/ \
        --bindir=/usr/local/sbin/

You might consider changing the location of the log files to
'--with-logdir=/usr/local/dansguardian/logs/' and use the provided
log rotation script.  Alternatively stick with the default
(/var/log/dansguardian/) and read newsyslog(8).


NETBSD:
-------

A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
NetBSD and the associated programs in their default locations.
    ./configure  --localstatedir=/var \
        --prefix=/usr/pkg
        --sysconfdir=/usr/pkg/etc \
        --bindir=/usr/pkg/sbin/

For NetBSD you might consider changing the location of the log files
to '--with-logdir=/usr/local/dansguardian/logs/' and use the
provided log rotation script.  Alternatively stick with the default
(/var/log/dansguardian/) and read newsyslog(8).
Be sure that /usr/sbin/ is in your PATH before make install (for chown).


FREEBSD:
--------
A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
FreeBSD and the associated programs in their default locations.

    ./configure  --localstatedir=/var

For FreeBSD and OpenBSD you might consider changing the location of the
log files to '--with-logdir=/usr/local/dansguardian/logs/' and use the
provided log rotation script.  Alternatively stick with the default
(/var/log/dansguardian/) and read newsyslog(8).


OPENBSD:
--------
A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
OpenBSD and the associated programs in their default locations.

    ./configure  --localstatedir=/var \
        --bindir=/usr/sbin \
        --mandir=/usr/share/man \
        --sysconfdir=/etc

SOLARIS:
--------

Only Solaris 8 (7/01 and beyond) and Solaris 9 has been tested.
DansGuardian requires the GNU version of make (gmake), and GCC version
3.01 will *not* work; use 2.95.3 or a more recent version.

Both gmake and GCC 2.95.3 are included with the OS on the "Companion CD",
and are usually installed in /opt/sfw/bin.  To ensure these are in your
path, simply do (in csh; bash syntax is different):

    setenv PATH /opt/sfw/bin\:$PATH

Also, to ensure that the right libraries are used, simply do:

    setenv LD_RUN_PATH /opt/sfw/lib:/usr/lib

Before you *compile* (not necessary during run-time).

To configure and compile, do:
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/dansguardian \
      --bindir=/opt/dansguardian/sbin \
      --with-logdir=/opt/dansguardian/log \
      --with-piddir=/var/run





HOW TO CONFIGURE:
-----------------

Edit the dansguardian.conf, dansguardianf1.conf and other files.
The files are commented well.




ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS:
-------------------

In /usr/local/share/dansguardian/scripts (or wherever you configured
it to be) you will find at least the following files:
bsd-init - a BSD style startup script to be put in your rc.d
solaris-init - a Solaris style startup script to be put in your rc.d
systemv-init - a Linux style startup script to be put in your rc.d
dansguardian - a logrotate.d file
logrotation - a sh script to rotate the logs
../dansguardian.pl - a cgi script for an access denied page

The installation of startup scripts used to be done by the
DansGuardian build scripts but since moving to autotools it is
deemed out of the scope of source code and is the playground of
packagers and sysadmins.

This is also true of log rotation scripts.  You can choose to use
the example logrotate.d file or you could crontab the logrotation
script thus:
crontab -e
59 23 * * sat /usr/local/share/dansguardian/scripts/logrotation
(now save)
I.e. 23:59 every Saturday.  Or change to as pleases you.

If you wish to use the cgi denied script rather than the template
html denied page you will find it in:
/usr/local/share/dansguardian/ (or wherever you configured it to
be).  This is not usually recommended but if you do want to do
this copy it to your web servers' cgi-bin directory.
This used to be mandatory and automatic in earlier versions of
DansGuardian.



HOW TO RUN:
-----------

You can start it by just running the binary.  You can stop it by
appending a ' -q' to the end, thus: 'dansguardian -q'.  Or you can use
the SysV(-like) script provided.



HOW TO GET HELP:
----------------
http://dansguardian.org/

Here is the first place to start for getting support.  There is a mailing
list available for those that do not find the answers to their questions
from the url above. The mailing list can be found at the url.  Please
DO NOT email the author for support as you will be just directed at the
mailing list.



HOW TO COMPILE STATICALLY WITH ZLIB: (Provided by Ernest W. Lessenger)
------------------------------------

Note: these instructions might be now out of date due to changes in
the DansGuardian build process. Instead of editing the Makefile (step 3
below), you may instead wish to use the "--enable-static-zlib" and
"--with-zlib" configure options.

Step 0:
Configure DansGuardian as usual
        <start in the DG source directory>
        ./configure (plus options see above)

Step 1:
Download zlib and decompress it as a subdirectory of your DG installation.
Rename the decompressed folder as "zlib"
        tar xvzf zlib-1.2.1.tar.gz
        mv zlib-1.2.1 zlib

Step 2:
Configure and compile
        cd zlib
        ./configure
        make (DO NOT 'make install')
        cd ..

Step 3:
Minor tweaks to the DansGuardian source code and Makefile
(note these instructions are based on DG2.8 and thus are
out of date for 2.9 and later but you might be able to
adapt them)
        @@@ Makefile
        - DGCFLAGS = $(OPTIMISE) $(PASSVARS) -lz $(STATIC)
        + DGCFLAGS = $(OPTIMISE) $(PASSVARS) $(STATIC)
        - LIBS = /usr/lib/libz.a
        + LIBS = ./zlib/libz.a

        @@@ All other files
        - #include <zlib.h>
        + #include "zlib/zlib.h"

Step 4:
Make DG
        make

That should be it. You shouldn't receive any warnings, and zlib should be
compiled statically.
