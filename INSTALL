NOTE: Change release 3.1.0 onwards
----------------------------------
Due to differences in release levels of the GNU autotools on different 
platforms we are no longer including the configure script as part 
of the distribution.

HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
The distribution uses GNU autotools for building.

Run ./autogen.sh or autoreconf after downloading and unpacking
to (re)generate the configure script and Makefile.in files.

Most users should then follow the standard
"./configure; make; make install" process common to UNIX packages.  

Please read the sections below for your OS for the most widely used
configuration options.

*** Solaris users, please read the Solaris section first. ***

*** xBSD users, please ensure you have bash1 installed first ***

*** OS X / Darwin users, please read the OS X section first. ***

1.	  Run the ./autogen.sh script to generate the configure script.
	If an error occurs in running autogen.sh or ./configure then
	make sure you have an up-to-date version of automake tools and 
	then run autoreconf.

2.        Run the configure (./configure --help) script with
        the help option to see the user selectable settings.
        Default settings are shown in [].

3.        Run the configure (./configure) script with your
        options, if any.  It is HIGHLY LIKELY that you will
        want to change some options.  Please read down for
        suggested options for your platform.

4.        "make"** or "gmake" will now build E2Guardian.

5.        "make install" will create the directory structure and install
        all the files in the chosen paths.  For a more efficient
        install, try "make install-strip" which will strip symbol
	information to the DG binary smaller.

6.        "make clean" will remove the now un-needed object files etc.

7.        See the section later called ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS to add
        log rotation, optional CGI block page, startup scripts etc.


** You can often use "make -j 2" or "make -j 5" to compile DG faster,
   especially on multiple CPU computers.  As a general rule of thumb,
   use the number of CPUs/cores plus one.
   With Solaris and others you may need "gmake" instead of "make".
   


OPTIONS:
--------
`configure' configures e2guardian to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print `checking...' messages
      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
  -C, --config-cache      alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'
  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or `..']

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
			  [/usr/local]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
			  [PREFIX]

By default, `make install' will install all the files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' using `--prefix',
for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.

For better control, use the options below.

Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR           user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR          system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR       program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]
  --datadir=DIR          read-only architecture-independent data [PREFIX/share]
  --sysconfdir=DIR       read-only single-machine data [PREFIX/etc]
  --sharedstatedir=DIR   modifiable architecture-independent data [PREFIX/com]
  --localstatedir=DIR    modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]

  --with-filedescriptors=NUMBER
                          Force support of NUMBER filedescriptors (Maxchildren). 
			  In some cases, you must take steps to tune your system before compiling.
			  Depends on the OS. usually, the max FD_SETSIZE is set to 1024, so maxchildren can be set to 1018 or lower
			  You can change this value here (Linux) e.g #define __FD_SETSIZE 8192
			  - /usr/include/bits/typesizes.h
		          - /usr/include/linux/posix_types.h
		         For FreeBSD raise FD_SETSIZE in /usr/include/sys/select.h before preceeding with e2guardian compilation 
			 Before compiling/building also set ulimit:
			 ulimit -n 8192 (This line should be also set in the E2Guardian startup script)
			 And finaly add configure --with-filedescriptors=8192 
			 Now you can set maxchildren + preforkchildren to 8188 Max (8192 - 7 (reserved by E2))
  --with-sysconfsubdir[=e2guardian]
                          subdirectory under sysconfdir in which to place
                          config files

Some influential environment variables:
  CXX         C++ compiler command
  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  CPPFLAGS    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
              headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  CPP         C preprocessor
  CXXCPP      C++ preprocessor
  PKG_CONFIG  path to pkg-config utility
  PCRE_CFLAGS C compiler flags for PCRE, overriding pkg-config
  PCRE_LIBS   linker flags for PCRE, overriding pkg-config

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

See ./configure --help for more details.


HP-UX:
------

No specific notes are available.  Consult your documentation for file paths.
Otherwise follow the FreeBSD instructions which are likely to work.
(Contributions welcome!)



MACOSX:
-------

*** Note in order to do any compiling in OS X you need to install ***
*   the Developer Tools - an additional pkg called BSDSDK.pkg.      *

A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
MACOSX and the associated programs in their default locations.

    ./configure --localstatedir=/var \
        --mandir=/usr/share/man/ \
        --bindir=/usr/local/sbin/

You might consider changing the location of the log files to
'--with-logdir=/usr/local/e2guardian/logs/' and use the provided
log rotation script.  Alternatively stick with the default
(/var/log/e2guardian/) and read newsyslog(8).


NETBSD:
-------

A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
NetBSD and the associated programs in their default locations.
    ./configure  --localstatedir=/var \
        --prefix=/usr/pkg
        --sysconfdir=/usr/pkg/etc \
        --bindir=/usr/pkg/sbin/

For NetBSD you might consider changing the location of the log files
to '--with-logdir=/usr/local/e2guardian/logs/' and use the
provided log rotation script.  Alternatively stick with the default
(/var/log/e2guardian/) and read newsyslog(8).
Be sure that /usr/sbin/ is in your PATH before make install (for chown).


FREEBSD:
--------
A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
FreeBSD and the associated programs in their default locations.

    ./configure  --localstatedir=/var

For FreeBSD and OpenBSD you might consider changing the location of the
log files to '--with-logdir=/usr/local/e2guardian/logs/' and use the
provided log rotation script.  Alternatively stick with the default
(/var/log/e2guardian/) and read newsyslog(8).


OPENBSD:
--------
A standard configure script that should work, provided you have installed
OpenBSD and the associated programs in their default locations.

    ./configure  --localstatedir=/var \
        --bindir=/usr/sbin \
        --mandir=/usr/share/man \
        --sysconfdir=/etc

SOLARIS:
--------

Only Solaris 8 (7/01 and beyond) and Solaris 9 has been tested.
E2Guardian requires the GNU version of make (gmake), and GCC version
3.01 will *not* work; use 2.95.3 or a more recent version.

Both gmake and GCC 2.95.3 are included with the OS on the "Companion CD",
and are usually installed in /opt/sfw/bin.  To ensure these are in your
path, simply do (in csh; bash syntax is different):

    setenv PATH /opt/sfw/bin\:$PATH

Also, to ensure that the right libraries are used, simply do:

    setenv LD_RUN_PATH /opt/sfw/lib:/usr/lib

Before you *compile* (not necessary during run-time).

To configure and compile, do:
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/e2guardian \
      --bindir=/opt/e2guardian/sbin \
      --with-logdir=/opt/e2guardian/log \
      --with-piddir=/var/run



HOW TO CONFIGURE:
-----------------

Edit the e2guardian.conf, e2guardianf1.conf and other files.
The files are commented well.




ADDITIONAL SCRIPTS:
-------------------

In /usr/local/share/e2guardian/scripts (or wherever you configured
it to be) you will find at least the following files:
bsd-init - a BSD style startup script to be put in your rc.d
solaris-init - a Solaris style startup script to be put in your rc.d
systemv-init - a Linux style startup script to be put in your rc.d
e2guardian - a logrotate.d file
logrotation - a sh script to rotate the logs
../e2guardian.pl - a cgi script for an access denied page

The installation of startup scripts is
deemed out of the scope of source code and is the playground of
packagers and sysadmins.

This is also true of log rotation scripts.  You can choose to use
the example logrotate.d file or you could crontab the logrotation
script thus:
crontab -e
59 23 * * sat /usr/local/share/e2guardian/scripts/logrotation
(now save)
I.e. 23:59 every Saturday.  Or change to as pleases you.

If you wish to use the cgi denied script rather than the template
html denied page you will find it in:
/usr/local/share/e2guardian/ (or wherever you configured it to
be).  This is not usually recommended but if you do want to do
this copy it to your web servers' cgi-bin directory.
E2Guardian.



HOW TO RUN:
-----------

You can start it by just running the binary.  You can stop it by
appending a ' -q' to the end, thus: 'e2guardian -q'.  Or you can use
the SysV(-like) script provided.



HOW TO GET HELP:
----------------
http://e2guardian.org/

Here is the first place to start for getting support.  There is a mailing
list available for those that do not find the answers to their questions
from the url above. The mailing list can be found at the url.  Please
DO NOT email the authors for support as you will be just directed at the
mailing list.
