HOW TO UPGRADE FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF DansGuardian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the main configuration file and the filter group configuration file(s)
have changed since the last stable release.  If you try to re-use the
configuration from an existing copy of 2.8.0.6 or earlier, the daemon will
not start.  On the other hand, list files (phrase lists, domain lists,
etc.) have not changed format, and should largely "just work".  There have
been improvements to the default list files, though, so again it is
recommended that you start from the new version and re-do any customisations.

Before installing the new copy, first make a backup of your existing config
files.  For example:
	cp -r /etc/dansguardian/ ~/dansguardian.old/

Then install the new copy.  After doing this, you should re-apply the old
settings, importing them by hand; i.e. any setting you had changed from the
default should be changed in the new dansguardian.conf file, and the same
for other files such as dansguardianf1.conf.  Every option should be documented
by comments in the default configuration file; these comments are one of the
best sources of information as to what a particular setting means.

As a rough guide, when new releases are made, DG's version numbering will tell
you if there are likely to be configuration changes needed.  Version numbers
are in the form A.B.C.D, where A and B represent major and minor version
number; these change in response to relatively large changes where
incompatibility is almost certain.  If a new release changes C, there is
incompatibility, but the change is minor.  When only D is incremented, the
release is a bugfix release, and no changes should be necessary.

If in doubt ask on the mailing list.  See http://dansguardian.org/ for details.
