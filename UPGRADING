HOW TO UPGRADE FROM DansGuardian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the main configuration file and the filter group configuration file(s) have changed.
Read the e2guardian.release file which describes the main feature and enhancements in this version of e2guardian.

On the other hand, list files (phrase lists, domain lists,
etc.) have not changed format, and should largely "just work".  

Before installing the new copy, first make a backup of your existing config
files.  For example:
	cp -r /etc/dansguardian/ ~/dansguardian.old/

Then install the new copy.  After doing this, you should re-apply the old
settings, importing them by hand; i.e. any setting you had changed from the
default should be changed in the new e2guardian.conf file, and the same
for other files such as e2guardianf1.conf.  Every option should be documented
by comments in the default configuration file; these comments are one of the
best sources of information as to what a particular setting means.

This document is modified from wording orginaly in the dansguardian distribution.
