This is a new feature (in v5.3.4 onwards) which can help in trouble shooting

It would not normally be turned on on production systems, except when
diagnosing any sudden-death symptoms.

Enable by defining rqloglocation in e2guardian.conf

This log will be in the same format as access.log.  It shows all requests
before any processing is performed.

The filtergroup should be ignored as it will normally show the default group
as the record is wriiten to the log before any authentication plug-ins are
actioned.

The following information is provided in the 'what' field:-

thread_id - allows thread to be followed and also cross-matched to syslog and
access.log

TRANS, PROXY, THTTPS, MITM, REQMOD or RESPMOD showing the source of the
request

	TRANS - transparent http

	PROXY - requests via the normal proxy port(s) (8080 etc) - includes
		transparent http

	THTTPS - requests via tranparent https port + flags for presence of TLS
		and SNI

	MITM - requests from within a MITM session (can be via PROXY or THTTPS)

	REQMOD - requests to ICAP REQMOD service

	RESPMOD - requests to ICAP RESPMOD service

WARNING - this option also modifies the access.log!

With this option active the thread_id is also added to the front of the 'what'
field in the access.log to allow cross-checking between the logs.
