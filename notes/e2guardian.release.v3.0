Changed/Added features in e2guardian 3.0 not found in Dansguardian 2.12.0.3

Words in CAPITALS are the corresponding pre complier directives.

Tuning settings introduced/changed:- 
----------------------------------

- mapauthtoports conf option added - when off scans all auth plugs on every listening addr/port, when on maps auth plugins to addr/ports, default on
- Added, nonstandarddelimiter per filtergroupe By frederic Bourgeois

- mapportstoips conf option added - when off listens on every filterports on every IP address,
- when on maps filterports to filterip's, default on

- maxlogitemlength now defaults to 2000. Unlimited option removed due to potential buffer overflow issues.


Logic Changes:-
-------------

Rewrite of main process loop to reduce dependency on select() call which limited the number of child processes.  Use of epoll() on Linux systems makes the engine faster, more efficient and scaleable.

Note that the logic for handling SSL is changed.  In DG when either blanket block (or SSL blanket block) was active then an SSL site would not be blocked if site name matched either exceptionsitelist or greysitelist.   In e2guardian with blanket block (or SSL blanket block) active an SSL site will only be allowed if it matches exceptionsitelist or greysslsitelist.  This ensures that only trusted sites can be accessed via SSL.  The greysslsitelist is used in order to allow a site to drop through so that it's domain can be mangled via urlregexplist, e.g. To use the Google mechanism for prevention of https Google search, or to allow an SSL site whilst blocking the corresponding http: site.  Legacy (DG) style logic can be restored using the ssllegacylogic flag (v3.2.0 onwards only)

Maxlogitemlength code moved into ConnectionHandler.cpp so as to prevent 
very large URLs corrupting log messages and to lower load on inter-process 
communication. 

URL cache - Cache is now only checked (or added to) if URL is less than 2000 bytes and method is GET.

Emtpy list set issue fixed - was causes failure of logging and URLcache processes when filtergroup was set to block all.

Authentication Plug-ins:-
-----------------------

Port based auth plug-in - filtering group assigned by destination port.  To use this feature  mapauthtoports must be set to 'off'. Complied as standard.

DNS Authentication - PRT_DNSAUTH - DNS based auth plug-in for use with Protex authentication system. To enable this use configure option --enable-dnsauth

New Lists:-
---------

Total Block List - Ability to read total block lists from stdin on startup – List cannot be overridden. 

Local Presidence - Local versions of lists added (localsiteexceptionlist, localurlexceptionlist etc).  Logic flow changed so that all local lists are checked before main lists so that they have presidence over main lists.  
To enable this use the option enablelocallist=on in e2guardianfn.conf

Search Word blocking  - Specific search word blocking  - bannedsearchlist, bannedsearchoveridelist, localbannedsearchlist added.  Searchregexplist is used to extract search words from search engine url call.  The existing weighted search word block is also retained, but note that searchregexplist is used instead of searchengineregexplist to determine a search url and extract the search terms. Compliled as standard.

Referer Exceptions - Exceptions based on URL in refering url. 
Refererexceptionsitelist and refererexceptionurllist added. Also embededreferersitelist and embededrefererurllist. Compliled as standard. To disable do not define lists.

Add an http header based on url regex - addheaderregexplist - needed for YouTube for schools.  Compliled as standard. To disable do not define list.

Regular Expression Redirects - urlredirectregexplist - allows browser redirection to different site.  Compliled as standard. To disable do not define list.

Specific SSL lists added - bannedsslsitelist , greysslsitelist + local versions.  Complied as standard. 


New Log Format:-
--------------

Logging - two new logfileformats have been added which are easier to parse than the standard DG format.
5 - Protex format type 1 – -ab delimited, squid style format with extra fields for filter block/result codes, reasons, filter group, and system name – used in arrays so that combined logs show originating server.
6 - Protex format type 2 – -ame format as above but system name field is blank – used in stand-alone systems.

Messages file amended:-
---------------------

Amendments to messages file -  user and log messages have been made more 
meaningful for the user, new messages added for the new list types and
hard-coded log and user message wording has replaced with new message lines
so that these can be translated.

Translations are required, please submit these 
to maintainer@e2guardian.org and these will be included in a future release.

A version of the messages file with legacy (dansguardian style) worded messages is 
provided as messages.alt (UKenglish only).
