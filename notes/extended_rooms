Extended Room functions in e2guardian

Hosts in a room can have a override list of urls with or without a blanket block function.

File format:-

1st line must contain a '#' followed by the room name

The following lines define the IP ranges, one IP or range per lines e.g.
172.167.58.3
172.167.59.1-172.167.59.65
177.167.60.0/255.255.255.0
177.167.61.0/24

End the list with:
#ENDLIST

Then optional whitelists can be added by using #SITELIST or #URLLIST
Each list must be ended with #ENDLIST

To block all access (other than listed in one of the above lists) use #BLOCK.

If #BLOCK is absent than the trusted sites listed will overide any block in the users filter group.

So there are 4 cases:-

1.  #BLOCK and no (#SITELIST or #URLLIST) - block all access
2.  #SITELIST and/or #URLLIST and no #BLOCK - trust these urls and allow normal access.
3.  #SITELIST and/or #URLLIST and #BLOCK - only allow these urls.
4.  #SITELIST, #URLLIST, #BLOCK all missing - Legacy format file - block all access.

e.g.

#MyRoom
172.167.58.3
172.167.59.1-172.167.59.65
177.167.60.0/255.255.255.0
#ENDLIST

#SITELIST
site1.com
site2.net
#ENDLIST

#URLLIST
site3.com/url
site4.net/url
#ENDLIST

#BLOCK
