e2guardian  v4/v5  dstats.log columns  - Note the format differs from v3.x

1. Time  - in unix format

2. httpw - Number of httpworker threads running

3. busy - Number of httpworker threads busy handling connections at current time

4. httpwQ - Number of connections waiting in queue for a worker thread.   
   In normal use this will be 0 (and on occasion 1 or 2) but will increase once 
   all worker threads are busy.   Lowish numbers are OK for transitory peaks.  
   High numbers indicate an overloaded system.   If there is still memory and 
   cpu available, then httpworkers may be increased.

5. logQ - Number of messages waiting to be logged to disk.   In normal use 0.  
   An increase in number may indicate system overloading, but should not 
   otherwise affect performance.

6. conx - number of connections handled since last stats line.

7. conx/s - average connections per sec over period since last stats line.

8. reqs - indication of number of requests handled since last stats line.  
   Only an indication as requests made over https tunnels (i.e. non-MITM) cannot
   be counted, so each https tunnel is counted as one request.

9. reqs/s - average requests per sec over period since last stats line.

10. maxfd - Indication of the maximum number file descriptor used.

11. LCcnt - Number of List Option Containers in use. A new List Option Container
   is created at start up and on gentle restart.  Old containers are deleted
   once all connections still using it have finished.  Normally figure will be 
   one, but may rise after a gentle restart(s) and should return to one after a 
   period of time.
