ICAP - Brief notes

ICAP REQMOD and RESPMOD now enabled

REQMOD service does url checking and any url modification and logs blocked requests.

RESPMOD service does content checking where REQMOD has not identified request 
as an exception, and logs request.

Possible modes are:-

	REQMOD only

	REQMOD and RESPMOD (recommended)

	RESPMOD only is not supported

REQMOD service communicates user, filtergroup and classification of request via
X-ICAP-E2G ICAP header

To enable uncomment icapport in e2guardian.conf

Default filter group can be set for ICAP using:
defaulticapfiltergroup

If user is passed from Squid, the user's filtergroup is now looked up
in the filtergroupslist.   If no match or no user passed, will check any
ip-based auth plugin enabled to get the group.

Suggest these lines in squid.conf for testing:-

icap_enable on
icap_service service_req reqmod_precache bypass=0 icap://127.0.0.1:1344/request
icap_service service_resp respmod_precache bypass=0 icap://127.0.0.1:1344/response
