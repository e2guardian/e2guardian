Lists via stdin

This option replaces the totalblocklist feature in previous versions.

It allows lists to be read via stdin on e2guardian start-up.  To activate use
the -i option.

List syntax is as normal but with added directives to define lists and indicate
the end of a list.  Only sitelist and urllist types are currently supported.

To define a site list use the #SITELIST: directive followed by the list
definition, then a list of sites, terminated with an #ENDLIST line.

#SITELIST:name=list_name, path=memory:psuedo_path_name [ other_modifiers ]

site1
site2
siteN

#ENDLIST

To define a url list use the #URLLIST: directive followed by the list
definition, then a list of urls, terminated with an #ENDLIST line.

#SITELIST:name=list_name, path=memory:psuedo_path_name [ other_modifiers ]

url1
url2
urlN

#ENDLIST

Where list_name is a label as defined in V5_list_definition,
psuedo_path_name is a unique label for this list and
other_modifiers are any optional parameters of a list definition.

These lists are added to any lists defined in e2guardian.conf and can used in
pre-auth.story storyboard.
